# Ecommerce-webpage-challenge
Website challenge that I've completed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that simulates a e-commerce page of a product which user can view the product in lightbox and switch images through the image gallery. Webpage also simulates a simple cart and in-cart system which user can add items to cart and remove from it.
